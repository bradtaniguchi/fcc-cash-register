# fcc-cash-register

This is code used for the freeCodeCamp [cash register project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register).

## Description
This code isn't the most optimal, but it works and this was the hardest challenge I ran into to the point I put it off for a few years (!). It works with minimal changes. (just need to remove `module.exports`)
